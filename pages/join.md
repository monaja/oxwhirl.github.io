### Joining WhiRL

* **Master's students:** If you want to do a thesis project in the lab, feel free to get in [contact](https://oxwhirl.github.io/pages/contact.html). We will do our best to find a suitable project within the lab. Unfortunately, we can only take a few students a year.

* CDT students: We regularly offer mini-projects to first year CDT students.   In addition, you are welcome to propose your own project idea, as long as it relates to active WhiRL research topics.

* Potential DPhil students: We typically accept two new DPhil students per year. To apply, follow the [normal procedure](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/dphil-computer-science) and specify Shimon Whiteson as a potential supervisor.  There is no need to contact Shimon directly.

* Potential postdocs: Vacancies arise periodically and are advertised on the [department webpage](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/aboutus/vacancies/vacancy-research.html).

***We particularly encourage women, minorities, and members of other underrepresented groups to apply for positions in the lab.***
