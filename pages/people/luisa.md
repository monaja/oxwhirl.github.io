My PhD research focuses on meta reinforcement learning. I'm co-supervised by Shimon Whiteson and Katja Hofmann (Microsoft Research).

I have a B.Sc. in Mathematics (University of Hamburg) and a M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence (University of Amsterdam). Before starting my DPhil, I worked at the University of Brussels as a research assistant for one year, under the supervision of Ann Now√© and Diederik Roijers.
