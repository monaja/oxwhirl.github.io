My current research is focused on behavioural abstraction in reinforcement learning, and its connections to generalization, continual learning, interpretable learning, and language grounding. Still just trying to make HRL work! Also fascinated by off-policy RL and model-based methods. Other than that, I make some motion graphics in my free time!
Previously, I received my Bachelor's in Cognitive Science and Masters in Machine Learning at McGill University under supervision of Prof. Joelle Pineau.
