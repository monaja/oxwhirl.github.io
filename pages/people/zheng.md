I am a DPhil student at WhiRL, advised by Shimon Whiteson. I'm also a member of AIMS CDT. I'm generally interested in improving the efficiency and generalization of reinforcement learning to make it more applicable in real world, with a specific focus on meta-reinforcement learning to achieve this goal. 

Previously, I graduated with Bachelor in Electronic Engineering and Master in Computer Science at Tsinghua University, working on automated machine learning under the supervision of Wenwu Zhu.
