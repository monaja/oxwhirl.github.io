I am a second-year PhD student co-supervised by Yee Whye Teh and Shimon Whiteson.

I am excited about fundamentals in RL, making more sample-efficient algorithms, exploration, representation learning and generalization. I am also interested in deep generative models and deep learning in general.

Before that, I graduated with a master in Applied Mathematics from Ecole Centrale Paris and a master in Statistics from Imperial College London.
