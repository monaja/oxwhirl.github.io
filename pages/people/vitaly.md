Iâ€™m an AIMS CDT student, interested in how machine learning models (especially in reinforcement learning) can use any prior information we can provide: human demonstrations, knowledge databases, other models predictions.
I graduated with BSc in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from Moscow State University and with a Masters in Media Informatics from RWTH Aachen University. Prior to joining the University of Oxford, I worked as a junior researcher for Latent Logic, working on Learning from Demonstration in the autonomous driving domain.
