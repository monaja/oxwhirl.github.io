I am a member of the AIMS CDT, co-supervised by Shimon Whiteson and Jakob Foerster. My research objective is to improve the generalization and sample-efficiency of reinforcement learning agents, with emphasis on meta, open-ended and representation learning.

I graduated with an MSc in Machine Learning from UCL, where I was a member of the UCL DARK Lab, and a BSc in Computer Science from Cambridge. In industry, I have worked on question answering at Amazon Alexa, efficient neural network inference at Arm and a computer vision pipeline at a security startup.
