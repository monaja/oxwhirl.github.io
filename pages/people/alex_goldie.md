I am a student on the AIMS CDT co-supervised by Shimon Whiteson and Jakob Foerster. My current research focuses on the intersection of meta-learning and optimisation; in particular, learning to improve on update rules like SGD or Adam for optimising RL algorithms.

Before starting my PhD, I graduated with a degree in Engineering Science from Oxford University. If you have any questions, or want to reach out, please contact me at [my email](mailto:goldie@robots.ox.ac.uk).
