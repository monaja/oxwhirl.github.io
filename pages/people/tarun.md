I'm a first year DPhil student under the supervision of Shimon Whiteson. My research interests are in reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, transfer learning, graphical models and deep learning. I'm being funded by Clarendon scholarship, University of Oxford. Previously I graduated with a bachelors and masters degree in Computer Science from IIIT Hyderabad, India. Before starting my DPhil, I worked at Singapore Management University as a research engineer for one year, under the supervision of Akshat Kumar.
